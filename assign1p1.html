	<h1>Master Shake</h1>
	<p>Master Shake, usually referred to as simply Shake, is one of the three main characters (alongside Frylock & Meatwad) of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Teen_Hunger_Force">Aqua Teen Hunger Force</a>. The self-proclaimed leader of the Aqua Teens, Shake is the most erratic, selfish, and idiotic of the group, delivering misfortune to those around him (most especially his next-door neighbor Carl), though his extreme stupidity and naivety frequently causes his various schemes to backfire on him. He is voiced by Dana Snyder and appears in every episode besides "Sirens", "Storage Zeebles", and "Spacecadeuce".</p>

	<h2>Appearance</h2>
	<img src="./FatShake.png" />
	<p>As his name implies, Master Shake is a giant white milkshake drinking cup with a pink bendy straw protruding from his head. Although Master Shake does not have a nose, arms, legs or feet, and any reproductive organs, he does have two yellow hands with only four fingers connected to each side of him. His lack of arms is shown to make picking up objects somewhat difficult. While Shake doesn't have legs, he refers to his base as his "one thick ankle" in "Kangarilla and the Magic Tarantula." Just like Meatwad and Frylock, Shake occasionally wears clothing, but does not typically wear them.</p>
	<h2>Personality</h2>
	<img src="./Guitar_Love.png" />
	<p>Master Shake is incredibly selfish, narcissistic, and self serving, helping others only if doing so will benefit himself. He possesses very little empathy towards the suffering of those less fortunate, and he completely disregards the rights of others, stealing and/or destroying their property at will, such as destroying the TV on multiple occasions. In addition, he literally has the temper of a spoiled child, frequently throwing tantrums if things do not go his way. This is observed in the episode PDA, where he throws a chair out of the window.</p>
	<p>Shake is also shown to be incredibly unintelligent and naive, and he frequently concocts asinine schemes in order to get his own way. Fortunately, these schemes rarely turn out well for him, and he often feels the painful backlash whenever his plans fail. Not only does he seem incapable of seeing the various flaws in his plans, but he also legitimately doesn't seem to be able to help prevent himself from making bad decisions. His stupidity has frequently caused much damage to the city they live in, their own house, the various people he encounters and perhaps most frequent of all, himself. Due to his massive ego and narcissism he often refuses to acknowledge his mistakes.</p>
	<p>Despite his lack of talent and overall stupidity, Shake possesses an exceptional knowledge in cooking. In "Lasagna", he is revealed to make a professional dish of four-cheese lasagna, which he claims to have learned how to make when he traveled to New York. In addition, "Super Sir Loin" reveals that Shake knows how to cook steak and eggs and duck Ã  l'orange. However, his ability to cook seems to only be used for malicious purposes, such as interfering with Meatwad's diet.</p>
	<h2>Powers & Abilities</h2>
	<img src="./ShellFishShake.png" />
	<p>Unlike his brothers Frylock and Meatwad, Shake does not appear to possess any kind of special or remotely useful powers. The only real power that he frequently displays is his ability to rhythmically contract his body and eject some type of thick, green fluid through his straw (which does absolutely nothing except splatter on the ground). He is also violently allergic to shellfish.</p>
	<h2>Jobs</h2>
	<img src="16-master-shake.jpeg" />
	<p>Given his laziness and contempt for authority, most of Shake's actual paying jobs (not counting his get-rich-quick schemes that never pan out) have been forced on him by Frylock and never last very long. The closest thing Shake has had to an actual job is likely found in the episode "Robositter," where he worked at "Slurp-a-Lunch" at the mall with Frylock as his supervisor. This job involved him turning meats, particularly ham, into smoothies. Shake quickly decided that the job was stupid and started goofing off. He even broke into a room that only managerial staff are allowed into, so he could steal and destroy the rain poncho that Frylock was working so hard for. The only other instance of Shake performing a relatively honest job was in the episode "Piranha Germs," where he was hired to spread a deadly disease.</p>
	<p>Shake has also tried making many business deals, usually to scam others out of money. In "Dumber Days," he tried to take advantage of Meatwad's newfound intelligence by taking ten percent of Meatwad's profits by doing almost nothing. Shake also pulled a scam with Carl sometime before the events of "The Meat Zone." This involved selling a large amount of tacky merchandise to promote an oil stain on Carl's driveway that vaguely resembled Jesus. He also tried becoming a musician in "Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary," where he made a deal with Zakk Wylde to create a new birthday song to replace the old one. He pulled a similar stunt, when he tried to become a musician after Meatwad became famous in "Chicken and Beans." He also tried to patent the "Buddy Nugget" behind Frylock's back in the episode "Buddy Nugget."</p>
